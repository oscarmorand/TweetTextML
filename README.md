# FinalProjectML
 
This is the final project for the "Introduction to machine learning" course at Hanyang University.
The goal of this project is to create a Machine learning model that predict early signs of depression and anxiety in social network users, here Twitter in our case study.

All the datasets used in the project are open-source and available for free on kaggle.com

Warning, the file TweetText_Dataset.csv is too heavy for GitHub, if you don't have the file locally on your machine in the datasets folder, you won't be able to run the src/TweetText part.
